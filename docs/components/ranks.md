# Ranks

The Ranks feature in our service provides organizations with the ability to manage their chain of command structure. This feature allows
organizations to create custom ranks, define the criteria for promotions and demotions, and assign ranks to personnel based on their
performance and achievements. With this feature, organizations can clearly define the hierarchy of their personnel, maintain accountability,
and promote a sense of structure and organization. Whether you are managing a small unit or a large organization, our Ranks feature gives
you the tools you need to establish and maintain your chain of command.
