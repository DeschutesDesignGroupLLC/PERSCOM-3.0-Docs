# Announcements

You can use the announcements feature in PERSCOM.io to communicate with your personnel in real-time. This feature allows you to post global
messages directly to your dashboard, ensuring that all of your personnel have access to the most up-to-date information. This feature is
especially useful for para-military organizations that need to communicate with personnel across multiple locations, as it provides a quick
and efficient way to share information with all of your personnel, no matter where they are.
