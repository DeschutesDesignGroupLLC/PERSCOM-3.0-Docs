# Documents

The Documents feature in our service provides organizations with a centralized document library to store and manage important files. With
this feature, organizations can upload and store documents, such as manuals, policies, procedures, and forms, in a secure and easily
accessible location. The Documents feature also enables organizations to assign documents to other components of the service, such as
personnel, tasks, and and service records. This makes it easy to ensure that personnel have access to the most up-to-date versions of
important files and that records are properly documented. The Documents feature provides organizations with a convenient and organized way
to store and manage their most critical information, making it easy to find the information you need, when you need it. Whether you need to
store and organize internal documents or share information with your personnel, our Documents feature gives you the tools you need to stay
organized and efficient.
