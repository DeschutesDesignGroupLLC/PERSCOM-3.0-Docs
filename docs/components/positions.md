# Positions

The Positions feature in our service allows organizations to define and manage the different positions within their organizational
structure. With this feature, organizations can create custom positions and specify the roles and responsibilities associated with each one.
This makes it easy to track who is responsible for what within the organization and ensures that everyone is aware of their specific
responsibilities. The Positions feature provides organizations with greater visibility into their personnel structure, making it easier to
manage and allocate resources as needed. Whether you are tracking upper management positions or defining specific roles within your
organization, the Positions feature gives you the tools you need to define and manage your personnel structure with ease.
