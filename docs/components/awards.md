# Awards

The Awards feature in our service allows organizations to establish and manage their own recognition system. With this feature,
organizations can create custom awards, set criteria for earning these awards, and track the awards earned by their personnel. This flexible
system provides a way for organizations to acknowledge the achievements and contributions of their personnel, and align with established
policies and procedures. Whether you want to recognize top performers, milestones, or simply show appreciation, our Awards feature gives you
the tools you need to create a meaningful recognition program.
