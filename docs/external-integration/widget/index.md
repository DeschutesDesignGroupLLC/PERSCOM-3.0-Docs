# Widgets

PERSCOM.io offers a powerful widget that allows the integration of your personnel data into another website for display. Each widget is a snippet of HTML that can be injected into your website where ever you'd like.

::: info
Each widget integration requires your PERSCOM Account ID and the use of an API key with the `access:widget` scope assigned. Your PERSCOM Account ID can be found under the Settings of your PERSCOM.io Dashboard.

### Development
The PERSCOM.io Widget project is **open source** and actively looking for developers to participate. If you have experience with frontend frameworks such as React, we encourage you to contribute.
